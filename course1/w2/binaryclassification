** Binary Classification **
//forward and backward propogation

Setup 
ex : cat(1) vs non cat(0)
64*64*3 (64pixels and rgb) 
x is feature vector , nx =dimesion of feature vector
nx= 1228
m traning examples   
(xi,yi) .... (xm,ym)
X is a matrix formed by stacking training examples and dimesion nx * m   

input and output labels
X.shape = (n_x*m) dimension 
for Y similiarly stack in columns 
Y.shape = (1*m) dimension
